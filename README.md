# Android Room with a View - Kotlin


In this code lab i build an app that implements the Android Architecture Components. The app stores a list of words in a Room database and displays it in a RecyclerView. 

What we build?

We learn how to design and construct an app using the architecture components Room, ViewModel, and LiveData.

The app does the following:
1) Implement the recommended architecture using Android Architecture Components.
2) Work with a database to get and save data, and pre-populate the database with sample words.
3) Display all the words in a RecyclerView in the MainActivity class
4) Open a second activity when the user taps the + button. When the user enters a word, that word is added to the database and displayed in the RecyclerView list.
